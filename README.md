# Spam Email Detection

We often recieve hundreds of mails in a month and some of them are spam and very few of them are actually important.

In this project, we will utilize Python to create a spam email detection system. Our objective is to train a machine learning model capable of identifying and categorizing emails as either spam or legitimate (ham). By doing so, we aim to efficiently separate undesirable and potentially harmful emails from our inbox.



## Tech Stack

**Used:** Python, pandas, numpy 

The dataset used has also been provided containing emails already differentiated between spam and ham.
